# Introduction
In this project, we have to analyze a dataset focused on analyzing and understanding gender inequality issues. The repository contains code, data, and visualizations related to various aspects of gender inequality, such as wage gaps, political representation, access to education, and more. The goal of this repository is to provide insights and promote awareness about gender disparities, leveraging data analysis and visualization techniques. It serves as a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and anyone interested in addressing gender inequality through data-driven approaches.

I have used the Gender Inequality Dataset which contains about 170 countries, and the Glassdoor Gender Pay gap dataset with 1000 columns. 

# What do I need to install?
You will need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:(pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and CSV) It will be recommended to install Anaconda, which comes with all of the necessary packages, as well as Jupyter Notebook.

# Why this Project?
Gender inequality is the social phenomenon in which people are not treated equally on the basis of gender. The treatment may arise from distinctions regarding biology, psychology, or cultural norms prevalent in society. Gender inequality remains a significant and persistent issue across various societies worldwide, affecting individuals in multiple aspects of their lives. From education and employment opportunities to economic empowerment and political representation, the disparities between genders continue to hinder social progress and equality. In order to address and combat these inequalities effectively, it is crucial to gain a comprehensive understanding of the extent and nature of gender disparities in different domains.

# Questions for analysis.
- Is human development gender specific?

- Does human development have a direct relationship with Gender Inequality Index?

- What is the relationship between the labor force and the gender Inequality Index?

- What is the relationship between the human development index, the Gender Inequality Index, and the distribution of parliamentary seats?

- What is the difference in gender base pay by job title and education?

- How does the performance of male and female employees compare?

# What I have learned?
After completing the project, I have;

- Mastered all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
- Become comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
- Understood how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
- Practiced communicating the results of the analysis
- Been able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up data analysis code
- Become familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
- Enjoyed using Matplotlib and Seaborn to explore data and produce plots showing findings
