The repository contains code, data, and visualizations related to various aspects of gender inequality, such as wage gaps, political representation, access to education, etc. The goal is to provide insights about gender disparities, leveraging data analysis and visualization techniques.

Gender inequality is the social phenomenon in which people are not treated equally on the basis of gender. The treatment may arise from distinctions regarding biology, psychology, or cultural norms prevalent in the society. Gender inequality remains a significant and persistent issue across various societies worldwide, affecting individuals in multiple aspects of their lives. From education and employment opportunities to economic empowerment and political representation, the disparities between genders continue to hinder social progress and equality. In order to address and combat these inequalities effectively, it is crucial to gain a comprehensive understanding of the extent and nature of gender disparities in different domains.

This data analysis project aims to explore and analyze gender inequality by examining various datasets and indicators related to education, employment, income, and representation. By delving into the available data, we seek to uncover patterns, trends, and key insights that can shed light on the existing gender disparities and their implications. The findings of this project will contribute to the growing body of knowledge on gender inequality, enabling policymakers, researchers, and advocates to make informed decisions and implement targeted interventions for promoting gender equality.

Objectives:
The primary objectives of this data analysis project are as follows:

Quantify and compare the educational attainment levels between genders, focusing on secondary education.
Investigate the gender gap in employment rates, exploring disparities in labor force participation and occupational segregation.
Examine the income gap between genders, analyzing wage differentials and the prevalence of the gender pay gap.
Assess the representation of genders in decision-making positions, such as political offices to understand the degree of underrepresentation.
Identify any significant correlations or relationships between gender inequality and other socio-economic factors, such as poverty rates and human development.
Methodology:
To achieve these objectives, I will utilize a combination of

Quantitative data analysis techniques. I will gather relevant datasets from kaggle. The datasets will be cleaned, standardized, and processed to ensure consistency and comparability across different variables.

Descriptive statistics, including measures of central tendency and dispersion, will be employed to provide an overview of gender inequality indicators.

Exploratory data analysis techniques. I will perform initial investigations on data so as to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test hypothesis and to check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.
